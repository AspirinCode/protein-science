**Apo structure**    
The observed structure of a protein if its ligand is not bound. In contrast to [holo structure](#holostructure)

<a id='conformation'></a>
**Conformation**    

- Ligands/proteins can exist in different conformations. Usually, "conformation" refers to the same chemical composition but with altered bond-angles between two/multiple ligands or proteins. See also [orientation](#orientation).

<a id='holostructure'></a>
**Holo structure**    
The observed structure of a protein in its ligand bound state. In contrast to [apo structure](#apostructure)


<a id='orientation'></a>
**Orientation**

- In contrast to [conformation](#conformation), the bond angles are the same between two/multiple ligands (as well as the chemical composition), but the orientation in space (transition, global rotation) is differs between two/multiple orientations.

<a id='pose'></a>
**Pose**  
A ligand pose describes the binding-mode of a ligand in a protein binding site. Typically, this is considered to be a combination of [orientation](#orientation) & [conformation](#conformation)
