**Conformation**    

- Ligands/proteins can exist in different conformations. Usually, "conformation" refers to the same chemical composition but with altered bond-angles between two/multiple ligands or proteins. See also [orientation](#orientation).

**Orientation**

- In contrast to [conformation](#conformation), the bond angles are the same between two/multiple ligands (as well as the chemical composition), but the orientation in space (transition, global rotation) is differs between two/multiple orientations.

**Pose**  
A ligand pose describes the binding-mode of a ligand in a protein binding site. Typically, this is considered to be a combination of [orientation](#orientation) & [conformation](#conformation)
