### Virtual Ligand Screening: Strategies, Perspectives and Limitations

A review about the current state of virtual screening (VS) approaches and software. The author provides a thorough discussion of advantages of VS, contrasts it to the alternative hight-throughput screening, and is largely focussed on the current shortcomings of VS.  
It is a nice review paper written in a rather general and introductory tone, which makes it especially worthwhile for people who are new to the field of computer-aided screening techniques.
