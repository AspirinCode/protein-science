# Literature notes

Those are my personal notes that I took after/while reading the mentioned articles and may largely reflect the points being made by the authors in my own words, flavored by my own thoughts.

The purpose is to build a handy collection with short overviews of good or important points, facts, and insights of the various articles. I started this just for personal reference, but maybe it turns out to be useful to one or the other to get a quick overview of the contents of an article to quickly evaluate whether it is worthwhile reading it.

Please consider that the notes are not "complete" - since I built it mainly for my personal use - but only the points that I find relevant or important for my applications/research/work.

### Virtual Ligand Screening: Strategies, Perspectives and Limitations

A review about the current state of virtual screening (VS) approaches and software. The author provides a thorough discussion of advantages of VS, contrasts it to the alternative hight-throughput screening, and is largely focussed on the current shortcomings of VS.  
It is a nice review paper written in a rather general and introductory tone, which makes it especially worthwhile for people who are new to the field.
